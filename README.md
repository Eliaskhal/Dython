# Dython: French-to-Python Translator 
## Overview
This Python-to-French Translator project aims to provide a more accessible version of Python for kids, allowing them to code using French keywords. The project consists of two main scripts: `main.py` and `translator.py`. The `main.py` script handles user input or file input, while the translator.py script translates French keywords to Python.
## main.py
### Description
`main.py` serves as the entry point for the Python-to-French Translator. It takes either a command line argument or user input to process Python code written in French.

### Usage
To run the translator with a file as input:
```bash
python main.py path/to/your/file.py
```
Or 
```bash
dist/dython.exe path/to/your/file.py
```

To run the translator in interactive mode:
```bash
python main.py
```
Or 
```bash
dist/dython.exe
```
